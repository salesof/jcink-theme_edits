# jcink-theme_edits
I added some javascript snippets to the jcink theme files to get some functionality done. I have used html, css and javascript here. Since I am new to javascript I have used jcink forums where some sweet people help others with coding problems. These snippets are originally from there but I have modified them to match the use case of my forum.

The forum can be seen here: https://magianroihu.jcink.net/index.php
